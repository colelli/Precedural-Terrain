# Procedural-Terrain
 A procedural terrain generator for my university study case.<br/>
 As part of my future study case, I want to create a game that involves generating random worlds (with set boundaries). This project aims at being just that: A random world generator.<br/>
 Being new to Unity I want to start with one, and one only, feature to develop and get function "to perfection", before moving on with a much bigger project.
